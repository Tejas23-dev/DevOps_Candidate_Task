Security Audit Script: Installation and Usage Guide
This document provides instructions on how to install, configure, and use the security audit script for your Linux system.

What it Does:

Performs a comprehensive security audit of your system, covering user and group management, file permissions, services, firewall and network security, IP configuration, updates, logs, and more.
Optionally applies basic server hardening steps like disabling password authentication in SSH and configuring a basic firewall.
Installation:

Save the Script:

Open a terminal and navigate to the desired directory.
Copy and paste the script content from the provided script file (assuming it's named security_audit.sh).
Save the script using a text editor like nano:
Bash
nano security_audit.sh
Use code with caution.

Make the Script Executable:

In the terminal, navigate to the directory where you saved the script.
Use the following command to grant execute permissions:
Bash
chmod +x security_audit.sh
Use code with caution.

Configuration (Optional):

Email Alerts:
The script can optionally send email alerts with the generated report.
Edit the script and replace your-email@example.com in the EMAIL_ALERTS variable with your actual email address.
Running the Script:

Run the script with the following command:

Bash
./security_audit.sh
Use code with caution.

This will execute all audit functions and potentially apply hardening steps.

Review the Report:

The script generates a report named security_audit_report.txt in the /var/log directory.
Open the report using a text editor to review the findings.
Customization (Optional):

The server_hardening function contains basic hardening steps. You can comment out specific lines within this function if you don't want them applied.
Consider exploring additional security tools based on your specific needs.
